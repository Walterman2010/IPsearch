# IPsearch
a smal slow phython tool to ping all IP-adress in a network
I created, because I doenÂ´t found something simular and needed to find all my Networkuser.
The bad think is slowly, becase we are ping all users and wait for the answer.
And ja, sorry for that, the comments are in german. may be I will fix it in the futrue.

the Value "# Suchradius" you define the start and end IP Adress.
here is just the last Values of the IP V4 in change
"von" Min IP
"bis" max IP

befor you run you need to change Ipadress, to that value is run in the same network like your PC
for Example: address = "192.168.0." + str(ping)

Best,
